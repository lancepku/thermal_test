Readme file for directory src10 &11 for code flac
modifications from standard src file from CIG/Luc Lavier/E. Tan
1. Time step reset on restart (when tolerance reset in .inp file)
2. Depth (zlock) for non-application of plastic strain weakening allowed in input (locked)
3. Dissipation or sshrheat set for only plastic strain not total strain
4. Output of velocity (array 'vel') for plotting is replaced by displacemnt (array 'disp') since start of run (or restart) in meters.
For src11
1. Added 2nd stage of plastic weakening.  Thus, read_params.f90 and fl_plastic.f90 were changed
2. Then, file *.inp RHEOLOGY input has to have a pls3,fric3, coh3 and dilat3.
3.  As with src6 HEALING OF THE PLASTIC STRAIN- now tau_heal is reference strain rate (note that above a strain of 1 the rate of healing is proportionate to accumulated plastic strain)
